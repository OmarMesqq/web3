### Interfacing web3 and web2 with Ethereum and Next.js 
In `dapp-backend` you will find the custom NFT smart contract, tests and deployment scripts. 
Whereas in `frontend` you will find the Next.js app that interfaces with the NFT logic and the blockchain, sets up routes, authentication etc.

The frontend is a modified version of the project from [Vercel's Next.js tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app).
